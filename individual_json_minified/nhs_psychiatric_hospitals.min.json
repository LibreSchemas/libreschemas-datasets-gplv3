This is usually escorted leave where a staff member escorts you on leave (such as to a local shop).

This means not surrounding the Autistic person with crowds of people watching within a short space. The use of the written word such as writing or mobile text messages may be a simple non-verbal way to communicate.

Giving the Autistic person space to calm down and providing anything that soothes them can make a difference. The culture of a psychiatric ward can involve \"patients kicking off\" (disruptive behaviour) and often leading to restraint.  An Autistic meltdown may appear like the Autistic person is \"kicking off\" when in actual fact it is due to a need not being met. It's common for an Autistic person to go into shutdown after the meltdown. Repeatedly asking the Autistic person questions (usually a member of staff examining the person) after the meltdown while in shutdown is not usually helpful.  Asking the Autistic person a few hours or days after the event when they are relaxed why the meltdown happened will be more helpful.","rank":5}],"adjustments_available":true},{"event_image_url":"https://api.neuroschemas.app/images/nhs_psychiatric_hospital_medication_640x480.png","rank":4,"event_name":"Medication and Restraint","behaviours_available":true,"behaviours":[{"rank":1,"type":"descriptive_norm","description":"During Ward Round the Doctor may give people options on their medication.

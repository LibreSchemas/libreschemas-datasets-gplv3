Creative Commons was designated as a proxy under Section 14 of the GNU General Public License (GPL) in order to allow future compatible versions of the GPL to be adopted if they have ShareAlike compatibility. For example, since 8th October 2015, the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0) license is one-way compatible with the GNU General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). Compatibility means you can take work received under the terms of CC BY-SA 4.0 and then distribute adaptations of that work under the terms of GPLv3. However, this compatibility is one-way only, meaning you can not release adaptations GPLv3-covered works under the terms of CC BY-SA 4.0.  For more information see:

A shutdown is when a Autistic person is not themselves and are only able to focus on basic needs. Restraining an Autistic person in a meltdown or shutdown can be traumatic. Much can be done to prevent meltdowns and shutdowns before they happen by knowing the causes, triggers, sensory considerations, anxieties and changes in routine. Giving the Autistic person space to calm down and providing anything that soothes them can make a difference. The culture of a psychiatric ward can involve \"patients kicking off\" (disruptive behaviour) and often leading to restraint.  An Autistic meltdown may appear like the Autistic person is \"kicking off\" when in actual fact it is due to a need not being met. It's common for an Autistic person to go into shutdown after the meltdown. Repeatedly asking the Autistic person questions (usually a member of staff examining the person) after the meltdown while in shutdown is not usually helpful.  Asking the Autistic person a few hours or days after the event when they are relaxed why the meltdown happened will be more helpful.",
